# Map Photo
This is my own project building an iOS application in Swift about using integrated map kit to determine to location of user as well as display photos which were taken around the location the the user drop pin on the map.
These photos are fetched from Flickr by using their API. The creation of this app is inspired by a course I took in Udemy.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Xcode 8 or above has been installed in your computer

## Installing
Clone the code to your computer and open with Xcode 8 or above

## Language
Swift 3

## Functionalities
1. Determine the location of the user. Zoom and center functionalities are also included.
2. Drop pin to a location on the map, then the application will display a collection of photos which were taken around that location using Flickr API.
3. Click on the photo cell to navigate to a bigger view of the photo. Double click to dismiss the bigger view. Swipe down to dismiss the collection view.
4. User could use 3D force touch to have a bigger preview of the photo.

## Performed skills:
1. Use Storyboard
2. Implement Map Kit, use custom annotation, handle the display of the map
3. Implement CLLocationManager to manage user location
4. Implement UITapGestureRecognizer and UISwipeGestureRecognizer
5. Implement basic animation
6. Implement Alamofire framework to handle data (JSON and image) from Flickr API
7. Implement 3D force touch  to preview photos
